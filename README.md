# Technical and Fundamental Analysis task

To solve this task we use a script that we made in python in which we read the data of the euro against
the zloty between the first of September of 2023 and the thirtieth of November and then we plot
information about the moving averages, the relative strength index (RSI), the moving average
convergence divergence(MACD) and the Average True Range(ATR).

- Moving averages

```
This indicates a bearish signal because the MA20 is below the MA50, but we can also see
how the trend might be slowly weakening because both lines are converging.
```
- Relative Strength Index

```
There we can see that the RSI are in the neutral zone (greater than 30 but lowest than 70), so
we cannot predict using this data, but the direction of the line indicates some impulse to the
trend and also, we can take into account the line of 50 that the index crossed recently.
```
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence


```
And finally, there we can see how the MACD line crosses above the signal line,
something that is considered a bullish signal, and this might indicate rising bullish
momentum and a good time to buy, and we can also wait to see if MACD line
crossing above the zero line, because it indicates bullishness.
```
- Average True Range

```
In this graph we see that the ATR had a low value, that indicates that the price has
a low volatility, that means that we canâ€™t expect important changes in the price.
```
After having seen all the information we obtain with the script we can appreciate how the
euro had been losing value against the zloty, but by paying attention to the signals, we
can try to predict that the bearish impulse of the euro ends and there is a good moment to
buy euro instead of zloty, by our interpretation we can see an upcoming bullish impulse
for the euro.


Also, by seeing the accumulation that the price do for 4 weeks we can see a breakdown
in the trend that confirm our hypothesis, we can wait until we see an increase in the
volatility using the ATR index to see how the market behaves and confirm if the change
in the trend that we try to predict is well founded.
In the same folder I adjunct the python script that we use to do this analysis.
